	- Create `/opt/new/` directory and create a file called `empty` under it:
		- mkdir /opt/new
		- touch /opt/new/emty
	- create hard link
		- ln /opt/new/empty /home/bob/samefile
- 5. 
	- All of the remaining files in `collection/` have some text content inside. Look through these all files and find the files that contain the letter `e` or `E`. For example, a file with the word `help` or `HELP` should match. Once you found these files, also move them to `/opt/foundfiles/` directory.
		- grep -ir 'e' /home/bob/collection/ 
		- mv /home/bob/collection/file575 /opt/foundfiles/
		- mv /home/bob/collection/file875 /opt/foundfiles/
	- Find the file that is `not readable by other users`, rest of permissions don't matter. Once you found this, restore the `+r` permission for `other users`. Make this single change, leaving all other permission unchanged, in their original form.
		- find /home/bob/collection/ -type f -perm 640 -exec sudo chmod o+r {} \;
- 6.
	- Find unique word and write this word to this file: /opt/word.txt 
		- diff yesfile1 yesfile2
		- bash -c "echo 'maybe' > /opt/word.txt"
- 7. 
	- Find word sort and list in lsmanpage.txt file and redirect the output to /opt/filtered.txt file:
- 8. Find word `sort` and `list` in `lsmanpage.txt` file and redirect the output to `/opt/filtered.txt` file: 
		- echo "grep -w 'sort' /home/bob/lsmanpage.txt  > /opt/filtered.txt"
		- echo "grep -iw 'list' lsmanpage.txt  >> /opt/filtered.txt"
- 9. 
	- change boot target of system to graphical.target https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/switch-boot-target-to-text-gui-in-systemd-linux/
		- systemctl get-default
		- systemctl set-default graphical.target
			- systemctl reboot [doesn't say to do this]
	- schedule power-off at 23:45 https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/switch-boot-target-to-text-gui-in-systemd-linux/
		- shutdown 23:45
- 11. 
	- List the `opened files` used by this process and save this list to `/opt/openedfiles.txt` https://alvinalexander.com/blog/post/linux-unix/linux-lsof-command/ Filter the PID and save the PID number to this file: /opt/pid.txt: 
		- pidof or lsof -p 
			- netstat -p  | grep cached
			- echo '<>' > /opt/pid.txt
			- Save the opened files list to /opt/openedfiles.txt file:
				- echo '<>'  >> /opt/openedfiles.txt"
- 12. A user tried to run a command with `sudo (root)` privileges but entered the wrong password.  Look through your system logs and find out the exact `username` that failed to provide the correct password. Then save this username to `/opt/userfail.txt ` For example, if the user called `smith` provided the wrong `password` then you just write `smith` to that file.
	- cat /var/log/secure | grep -i 'pass'
	- echo 'jane' > /opt/userfail.txt
- 16. In this exercise you will work with kernel runtime parameters.
	- List all kernel parameters that contain the word `cache`. Redirect this filtered output to the file `/opt/kruntime.txt`
		- sysctl -a | sudo bash -c 'grep cache > /opt/kruntime.txt'
		- 
	- Set the kernel runtime parameter `vm.swappiness` to this value: `5`. Make this both a `persistent change` and a `non-persistent change`. Otherwise said, every time this system boots in the future, the value of `vm.swappiness` should be set to `5`, automatically. But `vm.swappiness` should be changed to `5` for your current boot session as well.
		- Edit /etc/sysctl.conf file:
			- vi /etc/sysctl.conf
				- vm.swappiness=5
		- sudo sysctl -p
- 17. 
	- Set smith's password to
		- echo 'smith:Exam4Passed' | sudo chpasswd
	- Change their login shell to `/bin/sh`
		- usermod --shell /bin/sh smithss
	- Set a resource limit for this user. Make sure that `smith` can launch not more than `30 processes`. This should be a `hard` limit.
		- smith           hard    nproc           30
- 18. Inspect your system and find out what application is listening for incoming connections on `TCP` port `11211`. Write the `PID` number for the process associated with that application, to the following file: `/opt/pidof11211.txt`
	- ss -natp | grep 11211
	- vi /opt/pidof11211.txt
- 19.SSH into `node01` using user `bob` and password `caleston123`
	- Find out what `DNS` resolver(s) this system is using, save the `IP address` of at least one of the DNS resolvers to the following file: `/opt/resolverandroutes.txt`
		- cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver
		- vi /opt/resolverandroutes.txt
	- Print out the routing table of this system and save the output to the same file: `/opt/resolverandroutes.txt` Make sure you don't overwrite the previous file contents.
		- ip r >> /opt/resolverandroutes.txt
	- Add a static host to this system. The hostname you should add is `webserver` and it should statically resolve to the following IP address: `1.1.1.1`
		- vi /etc/hosts
			- Add 1.1.1.1 webserver line in it and save.
- 20. In this exercise, you will work with Docker. Perform the following actions:
	- List the containers available on this system. In your output, you should see only one docker instance available. Save its name (the one you see under the `NAMES` field in that output) to this file: `/opt/containername.txt`
		- docker ps -a
		- vi /opt/containername.txt
	- Remove the following docker image: `nginx`. You can make any change you think is necessary to achieve this.
		- docker rmi nginx
	- Create a new container called `exam4` that will run the `httpd` daemon. Use the `httpd` docker image for this container. Make sure port `8081` on the host is mapped to port `80` of the container.
		- docker run --name exam4 -p 8081:80 -d httpd [have to run it this way can't create it then start it as create has an issue with -d]
- 21. There is one virtual machine created on this system, but it's currently in a stopped state.
	- Start this `virtual` machine.
		- virsh list
		- virsh start vmname
	- Also, make sure this `virtual machine` will `automatically start` every time the system `boots` up.
		- virsh autostart vmname
- 22. You have a disk available at `/dev/vdb`.
	- Create a `500MB` `partition` on this disk.
		- fdisk /dev/vdb - n,p,1, ,+500M ,p, w
	- Create an `ext4` filesystem with a block size of `2048` bytes on this partition.
		- mkfs.ext4 -b 2048 /dev/vdb1
	- Manually `mount` this filesystem in the `/mnt` directory.
		- mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/
- 23. In your home directory you will find two files.
	- Edit this file, `imm.txt` and add the following text under the existing line: `New line added successfully`
		- lsattr file
		- chattr -i imm.txt
		- vi imm.txt
	- Edit this file, `app.txt` and correct that equation. It should be `1+1=2` instead.
		- chattr -a app.txt
		- vi app.txt
- 24. There is a `LVM` structure available. Perform the following actions:
	- **A.** Remove the following `PV`, physical volume: `/dev/vdd`
		- pvremove /dev/vdd
	- **B.** Create a `VG`, volume group. The name of this volume should be `examVG`. This VG should consist of only the `/dev/vdc` physical volume.
		- vgcreate examVG /dev/vdc
	- **C.** Create an `LV`, logical volume. Its size should be 100 megabytes. Its name should be `examLV`. Of course, this LV should be created on the `examVG` volume group.
		- lvcreate -L 100MB -n examLV examVG
	- **D.** Create an `xfs` filesystem with a `block size` of `1024 bytes` on the `examLV` logical volume.
		- mkfs.xfs -b size=1024 /dev/examVG/examLV
