Q's that I have troubles with to research later:
- unknown for previous attempts; 77%; 83%;
- find how many hard links this file has
	- ls -li [no this shows the Inode]
	- stat file[yes shows everything including the hard links number]
	- find -ls
	- ln -inum [no this errored perhaps not meant to be ln maybe ll]
	- ll -inum [shows just inode and file names]
- Create a BZipped compressed tar archive now:
	- tar -cjvf /opt/manyfiles.tar.bz2 /opt/manyfiles/
- Finally create a Zip archive:
	- zip -r /opt/manfiles.zip /opt/manyfiles/
- Unzip a zip file
	- unzip -d /opt/restoredzip backup.zip
- give a user a password [test does not accept usermod -p password]
	- passwd smith [then enter the password that way]
- Lock the password for the user
	- passwd -l employee2
- remove a user from a group
	- gpasswd -d user group
- Print out the `network routing table` and save the entire output to `/opt/routes.txt` file. Also make sure to preserve any existing content of this file.
	- ip route
- First, in your home directory you will find a file called `bobandjane`. Currently this file can only be read by `bob`. Add a new `ACL` permission so that `jane` can also `read` this. Jane should not have `write` or `execute` permissions, but only the `read` permission.
	- setfacl --modify user:jane:r bobandjane
- docker list all containers then remove all docker container images except for nginx
	- docker container list -a
	- docker images
	- docker rmi imageID
- Add an extra `DNS resolver` (nameserver) on this system: `8.8.8.8`
	- vi /etc/resolv.conf
- Add a `static host` so that the host called `database` resolves to this IP address: `10.0.0.12`
	- vi /etc/hosts
		- 10.0.0.12 database
- Find out the IP address of `eth1` interface on `node01` and add a `temporary static route` so that network traffic going to `192.168.5.0/24` is routed via the IP address you find.
	- ip route
	- ip route add 192.168.5.0/24 via 172.28.128.1[eth1IP]
- add a new acl for jane who can not write or execute only read
	- https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/298382/how-do-i-grant-different-permissions-for-each-user
	- chown bob:jane bobandjane
	- getfacl file
	- setfacl -m u:jane:r /home/bob/bobandjane
- `SIGHUP` signal to the `httpd` process
	- pkill -f httpd [check with pidof httpd]
	- kill -sighup [pidof httpd]
- create partitions and swap
	- partprobe [after creating the partitions]
	- mkswap /dev/vdb1 [copy the uuid]
	- swapon /dev/vdb1
	- vi /etc/fstab [/dev/vdb1 none swap defaults 0 0]
