[Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Case Study | Amazon EC2 Spot Instances | AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/bendigo-adelaide-case-study/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)

Bendigo and Adelaide Bank started migration to the cloud in 2020.  Their goals were optimatization of its architecture to comply with Australia's open-banking mandates.
- providing secure and resizable compute capacity for any workload;
- increase cost savings;
- improve the performance and availability of its digital services;
- achieve resiliency and scalability for fault tolerant workloads;
Bendigo had utilised EC2 instances and Amazon EMR.  
Through use of spot instances for its nonproduction workloads, saving them money, while letting customers take advantage of unused EC2 capacity.
By using EMR (Elastic MapReduce), which is a managed cluster platform that simplifies big data frameworks to process and analyse large amounts of data.  They use the managed scalling to increase elasticity and minimise service downtime.
Key benefits include: (all are approximated)
- reduced compute costs by 60%
- Improved the resiliency of its near-real-tim worloads by 30%
- Increased performance of its banking system by 20%
