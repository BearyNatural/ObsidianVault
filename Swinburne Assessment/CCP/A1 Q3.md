·       **Choose two** of these concepts, describe them, and outline its primary benefit.

**Identify at least three AWS cloud solutions/services** that directly address or are related to those concepts.



**IoT** - Internet of Things is a key component of smart factories.  Machines on the factory floor are equipped with sensors that feature an IP address that allows the machines to connect with other web-enabled devices.  This mechanization and connectivity make it possible for large amounts of valuable data to be collected, analyzed and exchanged.

**Automation** - Allows manufacturing companies to take full advantage of the volume of information generated not just on the factory floor but across their business units and even from patners and third part sources.  It can create insights providing visibility, predictability and automtation of operations and business proecesses.  i.e. machines are prone to breaking down during the production process.  Using data collected from these assets can help businesses perform predictive maintenance based on machine learning algorithms, resulting in more uptime and higher efficiency.
