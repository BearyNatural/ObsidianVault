**Briefly describe** the term Cloud Computing.



the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

**Cloud** **computing** is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as **computing** power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a **cloud** provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
