A developer mark has been assigned `Nautilus` project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for mark. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named `mark` on the `App Server 1`. Set `expiry date` to `2021-03-28` in `Stratos Datacenter`. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.
